 Papillon is a security module for Solaris (version 8 to 10) and
 OpenSolaris. The code has been inspired by the Openwall and the HAP
 Linux Kernel Patches. Papillon implements most mechanisms introduced by
 these two patches into the Solaris OE and integrates additional
 security mechanisms into the kernel.

 Papillon includes a restricted proc, several protections against common
 attack techniques and may operate completely invisibile to system
 users.

 A documentation is available in the doc/ directory:

     doc/papillon.pdf		Portable Document (PDF)

 The documentation covers all important aspects of the Papillon security
 module including a general description of the provided functionality
 and information for compiling and installing the module on a Solaris 
 system.
