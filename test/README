 This directory contains C programs and a shell script to test the
 functionality of the Papillon module. Follow the Papillon documentation in
 order to compile and install the security module. Enable all protections
 and features of the module.

 Compile the C test programs. Maybe it's necessary to modify the Makefile,
 but usually you won't have to change anything. A Sun C compiler or a GCC
 3.x is required for compilation.

    # make 

 Finally launch the test shell script and check if all features show the
 correct behavior. 

    # ./test.sh
   
 By changing the protections and features of the Papillon module using the 
 tool "papctl", you can do further tests with the provided shell script, 
 e.g. 
    
    # papctl -s r=off
    # ./test.sh

 In the above case the restricted proc should be disabled.
